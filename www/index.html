		Well I have gone through a number of different prototypes and ideas, basically exploring a number of concepts ive had lately while vizi is still in an early stage. This mostly equates to a lot of scratch work that I was hoping might be the right path. Turns out mostly that I realize the path I had been taken was the best for various reasons. This means vizi will not be using the QT toolkit. It also means it will not be canvas based in a browser, and it means a number of other things as well ;) So anyway, Ive got it all back on track, reimplementing various ideas that have cropped up during my scratch development and again vizi finds itself built on top of the excellent Pyglet Library and of course the most excellent SndObj Library.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>On my TODO list currently is implementing basic wav recording and sample looping capabilities as well as creating global sound Tables that you can use in place of the default Tables for objects like the Oscili, to varying effect.

        Migrated away from bzr and launchpad and moved src to <a href="http://github.com/dasacc22/vizi/tree/master">github</a> mostly due to technical problems with bzr on the windows platform. Suprisingly all the stuff I heard about git on windows was just plain wrong (and mostly involving the cygwin build which I didn't use). Also overhauling the backend drawing to start using QT so i can start leveraging the UI toolkit among other things. Speaking of which, everything I read about QT being monolithic and slow was just plain wrong as well.

            Publicly releasing the code under GPLv2 via <a href="http://www.launchpad.net/vizi">launchpad.net/vizi</a>. This is still very much in an experimental stage, feel free to contact me about getting it up and running.

            Made quite a few changes. Created a two control orb for manually setting parameters. Added more sndobj's besides Oscili, namely: VDelay, SndIn, Gain.
            Allow for creation and destruction of objects through keyboard shortcuts (for now). Also theres a little info box on hover that describes relevant parameters and identifies the type of sndobj (which is pretty important
            right now since i only have one control to rule them all). I plan on refactoring various parts of the code and trying to abstract out everything correctly for easy expansion into all sndobj's as well as make it easy to
            implement new custom controls with ease. Also on the agenda is to simply disable physics if pybox2d is not setup so that it can run standalone with just sndobj if necessary. Once these two things are done, im going to make
            a code release (Probably licensed GPL, only other consideration being something like bsd/mit/zlib style).

        First efforts towards a vision I have. I'm using sndobj and box2d with python. I shot a video for demonstration purposes. You might want to turn down the volume on your speakers. The demonstration makes use of Oscili's so it can be a bit hard to listen to at times. The physics engine can be paused to make things easier to manage or keep the sound playing. In the video, the rotation of the circle is tied to the frequency of the oscili.
